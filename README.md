![RDP Login](./images/xrdp_console.png)

Now you've connected to the P2 instance and know the location of the working directory. Let us move to the next step. 


## Experiencing DNNDK with Resnet50

In this module you will have a hands-on experience of Deephi DNNDK to quantize, compile,and deploy to Deephi DP-8020 card with a pre-trained Resnet50 network. 

Resnet50 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) is an image classifier trained with the Imagenet dataset. 
You will go through the following steps,
1. Quantization to generate the fixed-point network model
2. Compilation to generate DPU kernels
3. View main.cc written with DNNDK APIs
4. Hybrid compilation to produce the executable for DP-8020 board
5. Run it on DP-8020 board to see the result

Look into ~/dnndk/dp-8020/resnet50: 

![RESNET50](./images/resnet50_directory.png)

 The directories and files are organized as follows, 

* float.prototxt: 	pre-trained Caffe network model file to describe the network structure and parameter of each layer
* float.caffemodel:	pre-trained Caffe float-point (FP32) weight file
* decent: Deephi's quantization tool
* dnnc:	DeephiNeural Network Compiler
* decent_resnet50.sh: script for Resnet50 quantization
* dnnc_resnet50.sh: script for Resnet50 compilation
* decent_output: the output folder of Resnet50 quantization
* dnnc_output: the output folder of Resnet50 compilation

The directory and file arrangement of Inception_v1 and SSD are very similar. 

If you have interest, feel free to have a look into float.prototxt in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/resnet50/

The first layer on top is ImageData type with calibration images for the quantization. DNNDK does not support the mean file e.g. mean.binaryproto. Instead we use 3 mean values as shown below. 

![MeanValue](./images/meanvalue_calibration.png)

At the bottom of float.prototxt, two 'Accuracy' type layers have been added to compute top-1 and top-5 accuracy. 

![Top1-Top5](./images/top1_top5_accuracy.png)

### Quantization with decent

decent is used to convert a pre-trained floating point (FP32) network model to a fix-point (INT8) model without hurting the accuracy. Using 8-bit calculations help your models run faster and use less power. This is especially important for many embedded applications that can't run floating point code efficiently.

The network models we use are trained by Caffe. DNNDK toolchain support for Tensorflow will come soon. 

We've created a script decent_resnet50.sh for you. 

![decent](./images/decent_resnet_sh.png)

The command above quantizes the float-point model and automatically checks the accuracy of the quantized model.

Run: 
```
./decent_resnet50.sh
```

It takes about 4 minutes to complete.

During the execution, you can see some output information scrolling on the screen. The figure below shows how DNNDK uses calibration technique to measure the dynamic range of each layer without the time-consuming retrain process. 
          
![decent](./images/decent_compilation.png)
          
At the end, it checks the accuracy of the quantized model and generates the deploy.prototxt and deploy.caffemodel which are the input to the next step. 

![decent_deploy](./images/decent_resnet_deploy.png)
          
This concludes the quantization process. We successfully quantized the float-point Resnet50 model to the fix-point model and achieved with a good accuracy (top-1 0.7375, top-5 0.908) vs float-point accuracy (top-1 0.744, top-5 0.914). The decent quantization is simple, fast and accurate. 

Let us go to the next step. 


### Compilation with dnnc

In this step, you will use dnnc, Deephi Neural Network Compiler, to compile the quantized fixed-point model into DPU kernels which are ELF format object files containing the DPU instructions and parameters for the network model. Please note DPU is Deephi's Deep Learning IP core for Xilinx FPGA devices.

All the compilation will be done in AWS which generates the final executables to run on DP-8020 board. The DNNDK compilation has two phases: the 1st phase uses dnnc to generate DPU kernel ELF files; the 2nd phase, which is the hybrid compilation, all the DPU and CPU ELF object files and other necessary libraries (including DNNDK libraries) are linked together to generate the final executables. 

At this time, you will go through the 1st phase. 

A script dnnc_resnet50.sh has been created. 

![dnnc_resnet50](./images/dnnc_resnet50.png)

If you want to understand the meaning of the parameters of dnnc, just run ~/dnndk/dp-8020/tools/dnnc

![dnnc_help](./images/dnnc_help.png)

In this case, we target DP-8020 platform which uses Cortex-A53 based ZU9EG device, so the option “arm64” is used and the DPU IP core option “B4096FA” is chosen for dnnc. The details of the DPU IP core are beyond the scope of this workshop. Contact Xilinx for further info. 

Run dnnc:
```
./dnnc_resnet50.sh 
```

It takes about 1 minutes to complete. 2 kernels are generated. Kernel resnet50_0 will run on DPU, including CONV, BN, POOL, RELU, FC layers while Kernel resnet50_1 will run on ARM to implement the softmax layer. 

In general, if a certain layer cannot run on DPU, it will be executed on ARM. So the networks will be automatically partitioned into several segments by the dnnc compiler. Each segment corresponds to one kernel, either in DPU or CPU. 

Please contact Xilinx if you want to know if any specific layer has been supported by DNNDK/DPU. The details of layer support are beyond the scope of this workshop.
          
![dnnc_layers](./images/dnnc_layers.png)
    
dpu_resnet50_0.elf is generated in dnnc_output folder, which are the output of dnnc. It corresponds to the DPU kernel described previously. This elf file will be used in the next phase to generate the final executables.

![DPU ELF](./images/dpu_resnet50_elf.png)

### Use DNNAK APIs to program Resnet50 in main.cc 

To simplify the machine learning application programming, high-level DNNDK APIs written in C++ are provided for developers to write a main.cc file. The main.cc is in charge of DPU kernel management, CPU kernel implementation as well as the interaction between kernels and the system such as video peripherals. 

main.cc file for Resnet50 is in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/resnet50/src/

Examine the code in main.cc to get familiar with DNNDK APIs. The following shows a code snippet of function main() in main.cc:

![MAIN.CC](./images/resnet_main_cc.png)
    
The main operations are: 
* Call __dpuOpen()__ to open DPU device
* Call __dpuLoadKernel()__ to load DPU kernel resnet50_0 & resnet50_2 generated by dnnc
* Call __dpuCreateTask()__ to create task for DPU kernel resnet50_0 & resnet50_2
* Call __runResnet50()__ to do image classification 
* Call __dpuDestoryTask()__ to destroy Task and free its resources
* Call __dpuDestroyKernel()__ to destroy Kernel and free its resources
* Call __dpuClose()__ to close DPU device 

Please make sure the kernel and node names are aligned with the output log in dnnc compilation, shown as follows,

![Define Kernel](./images/resnet_define_kernel.png)
    
If incorrect node name is specified, the following kind of error will be reported while launching the running of ResNet50 demo:

![DNNDK Error](./images/dnndk_error.png)

The following shows a code snippet of function runResnet50(): 

![Resnet50 Code](./images/resnet50_code_snippet.png)

__runResnet50()__ does the following tasks: 
1. Read picture and set it as the input to DPU kernel resnet50_0 by calling dpuSetInputImage() API
2. Call dpuRunTask() to run Conv, Relu, Pool, FC operation etc. for DPU Kernel resnet50_0
3. Do Softmax operation on CPU using the output of full connection operation as input.
4. Output the top-5 classification category and the corresponding probability

For details of DNNDK APIs, please refer to DNNDK User Guide which can be downloaded from Deephi website - http://www.deephi.com/technology/dnndk 

### Hybrid Compilation & Running on Hardware Board

1. Copy the DPU kernel elf file from ~/dnndk/dp-8020/resnet50/dnnc_output/ into ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/resnet50 folder in which run make, the final executable file resnet50 will be generated.

2. Prepare hardware environment
   
    Deephi DP-8020 is used as the hardware platform for this workshop. A 16GB SD card which holds the boot image and necessary demo files has been provided as the boot device. 

    A 1080p DP monitor is required as the display. A USB UART cable and Ethernet cable are required to connect with your computer. A USB dongle is needed to connect with a USB keyboard and mouse as the input devices.

![Hardware Environment](./images/hardware_environment2.png)

Use the serial terminal software such as putty or Xterm with the setting: 115,200 baud rate, 8 data-bit, 1 stop-bit and none parity.

Insert the SD card in the slot and power on, if correctly, you will see Linux booting from the serial terminal. After booting, login in with username: root and password: root.

Then you need to copy the final executable file “resnet50” in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/resnet50/ from AWS to the board.

First, you can use scp command to copy the file from AWS to your computer. Then connect an ethernet cable between the board and your computer and setup the 
IP address as follows: 

For Linux, run the following command:

    ifconfig eth1 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

For Windows, please set the IP address accordingly. 

From the board, run ifconfig to check the IP address of eth0. If it is not 192.168.0.*, run the following command:

    ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0

Then you are able to use __scp__ or __pscp__ to transfer these two elf files to the board:

    scp resnet50 root@192.168.0.2:/root/samples/resnet50/ 


1. In the directory /root/samples/resnet50, run command ./resnet50 and see its output.

![Happy DOg](./images/happy_dog.png)

After the completion of this session, you will be able to: 
1. Quantize the pre-trained float-point network model to fixed-point quantized model
2. Check the network accuracy after the quantization
3. Compile the quantized model to generate ELF object files for DPU kernels
4. Have a basic understanding of programming main.cc with high-level DNNDK APIs
5. Make the hybrid compilation to generate the hybrid executables which runs on Xilinx embedded platform
6. Run the executables on Xilinx embedded platform to see the visual output

## Going Further with SSD

In this module you will go further to quantize, compile and deploy to Deephi DP-8020 board with a pre-trained SSD network. 

SSD (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) is a commonly used real-time object detection network for a wide range of applications. The backbone of SSD can use different networks such as Resnet, VGG, Googlenet etc. In this experiment, we will use SSD with VGG16 as the backbone. 

The overall flow of SSD experiment is almost the same with the previous Resnet50 lab.

The working directory is ~/dnndk/dp-8020/ssd/

It is quite straightforward to go through the lab by repeating the steps in Resnet50.
1. Run **./decent_ssd.sh** in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/ssd to generate depoly.prototxt and deploy.caffemodel in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/ssd/decent_output
2. Run **./dnnc_ssd.sh** to generate DPU kernel ELF file dpu_ssd.elf in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/ssd/dnnc_output.
3. Copy this ELF file into ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/video_analysis/model and run make, the final executable file video_analysis will be generated.
4. Then you need to copy the executable file video_analysis to /root/samples/video_analysis of the DP-8020 board and run

    ./video_analysis video/structure.mp4

You will see the following display with bounding box around different classes of objects.
The input image size is 480x360 and we can achieve 28 fps.

![Structure_MP4](./images/structure_mp4.png)

We are successfully running a modern object detection network to detect the vehicles, motorcycles and pedestrians in the city traffic in real time on an embedded platform. This is done within a few minutes with the help of DNNDK.

After completing this section, you will:

1. Be more familiar with the DNNDK end-to-end flow by repeating the steps
2. Be able to build a real-time multi-class object detection demo on Xilinx embedded platform in minutes.


## Try face detection with Densebox
It is easy to build a live-I/O embedded ML application with DNNDK. Now let us try to do real-time face detection with Densebox (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04874) using USB camera. Densebox is another popular object detection network with fully convolutional framework. We have a SDSoC ML workshop at XDF which shows how to create this demo step-by-step. You are more than welcome to join.
Let us continue our experiment. Enter ~/dnndk/dp-8020/densebox folder, the content is shown below:

![DenseBox Content](./images/densebox_content.png)

The Densebox network is already quantized and stored in the decent_output folder.

### Compilation with dnnc

Use dnnc_densebox.sh to compile the network into DPU kernel ELF file, the content of script is as follow:

![DenseBox Script](./images/densebox_script.png)

The kernel information is as follow:

![DenseBox Kernel](./images/densebox_kernel.png)

### Run densebox
Copy the ~/dnndk/dp-8020/densebox/dnnc_output/dpu_densebox.elf file to ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/face_detection/model folder.

Run **make** in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/face_detection, the final executable file face_detection will be generated in the same folder.

Copy the executable to dp-8020 board, connect the USB camera and DP monitor provided then run:

    ./face_detection

You will see faces detected in real-time with bounding boxes like below:

![DenseBox Faces](./images/densebox_faces.jpg)


## Practicing DNNDK with Inception V1(Googlenet)

In this module you will get hands-on experience writing code in main.cc, and using a Makefile to build and run Inception V1(Googlenet) with DNNDK.
Inception V1 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) is another popular image classifier trained with the Imagenet dataset.

You will go through the following steps,
1. Quantization to generate the fixed-point network model
2. Compilation to generate DPU kernels
3. Finish main.cc using DNNDK APIs and Makefile
4. Hybrid compilation to produce the executable for DP-8020 board
5. Run it on DP-8020 board to see the result

Change directory to ~/dnndk/dp-8020/inception_v1. The directories and files are organized similar to the Resnet50 project, as shown below:

![Inception Directory](./images/inception_dir.png)

### Quantization with decent
The script **decent_ inception_v1.sh** is similar to the resnet50 script.

![Inception Script](./images/inception_script.png)

Run decent

    ./decent_ inception_v1.sh

It takes about 4 minutes to complete. At the end, it checks the accuracy of the quantized model and generates the deploy.prototxt and deploy.caffemodel which are the input to the next step.

### Compilation with dnnc
In this step, use dnnc to compile the quantized fixed-point model into DPU kernels ELF files.

Run dnnc

    ./dnnc_ inception_v1.sh

It takes about 1 minutes to complete. 2 kernels are generated. Similar to Resnet50, kernel inception_v1_0 will run on DPU, while Kernel inception_v1_1 will run on ARM for softmax layer.

![Inception Kenerls](./images/inception_kernels.png)

dpu_inception_v1_0.elf is generated in dnnc_output folder. It corresponds to one DPU kernel described above. The elf file and kernel/input/output node names will be used in the next step to generate the final executables. We have dumped the kernel info in the ~/dnndk/dp-8020/inception_v1/kernel.info log file for the later use.

![Inception ELF](./images/inception_elf.png)

### Finish main.cc and Makefile
We need you to finish the main.cc in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/inception_v1/src folder with DNNDK API and the Makefile in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/inception_v1 folder.

Please refer to main.cc and Makefile of the resnet50 project for an example of how to finish it.

The missing elements of main.cc and the Makefile which you need to finish are shown in the following figures. Don’t worry if your code is incorrect. It will not cause any unrecoverable crashes. The message like undefined kernel or node will be displayed when you run it on the board.

**main.cc DEFINES**
![Main DEFINES](./images/inception_main_defines.png)

**main.cc Function**
![Main Function](./images/inception_main_function.png)

**Makefile**
![Inception Makefile](./images/inception_makefile.png)

After you have completed the coding, you should have a better understanding of how to write application code with DNNDK APIs and how to use the generated DPU kernels in the compilation process.

If you are not able to finish the coding, which is not unusual for the first time, you can find the completed main.cc and Makefile in ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/inception_v1/.backup folder. You can view the completed code, and use it to complete the lab. 

Copy the completed main.cc to ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/inception_v1/src and copy the completed Makefile to ~/dnndk/dp-8020 /samples/inception_v1

### Run inception v1
Copy the DPU kernel elf file dpu_inception_v1_0.elf from ~/dnndk/dp-8020/inception_v1/dnnc_output into ~/dnndk/dp-8020/samples/inception_v1 folder and run make. The final executable file is generated in same folder. 

Copy the executable onto DP-8020 board and run:

    ./inception_v1

You will see the following display with image and the top-5 probability.

![Inception Results](./images/inception_results.png)
